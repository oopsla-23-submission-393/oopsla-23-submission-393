# Matching Logic in Metamath Zero

This repository represents our efforts to capture the full extent of [Applicative Matching Logic](https://fsl.cs.illinois.edu/publications/chen-rosu-2019-trb.html) in Metamath Zero as well as an axiomatization of the theory of Regular Expressions in Matching Logic.

Moreover, the repository includes a decision procedure that is able to generate machine checkable Metamath Zero proofs for the totality of any regular expression (for now only over a signature composed of two letters: `a` and `b`) in Maude thanks to a technique based on [Brzozowski derivatives](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/321239.321249).

## Requirements and Installation

All the installation instructions are with respect to a Unix based system. For other operating systems these instructions would have to be adapted.

The minimum requirement to compile and verify the core theory `mm0`/`mm1` files is an installation of the [Metamath Zero](https://github.com/digama0/mm0) toolchain (specifically `mm0-c` and `mm0-rs`). If the user doesn't have these tools installed, they can be easily built inside this repository by following the instructions below, provided that the user has the following requirements:
* gcc
* Rust 1.67

Additionally, in order to run the proof generation procedure, the following need to be installed:
* Maude 3.2.1 \*
* Python 3.9.13
* Poetry \*\*

\* If the user doesn't have Maude installed on their system, appropriate Maude binaries are provided inside this repository for Linux and macOS distributions (see installation instructions below).

\*\* Poetry can be installed by running the following command:
```
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

The easiest way to install all the tools and requirements of the project is by running:
```
./install.sh
```
If installing on a Mac, run instead `./install macOS`

This includes building the Metamath Zero toolchain under this repository, installing required Python modules in a virtual environment via Poetry and selecting an appropriate Maude binary to use.

## Running the Test Suite

To make sure that everything works correctly, we encourage users to try running the test suite for this project. Doing this is as simple as running:
```
./test
```

**Note:** Since some tests take a long time to complete we recommend that users first run `./test --skip-slow` instead, in order to skip the very slow tests.

If any failure occurs, please report this on the Issues page of this repository.

## Project Overview

Here we will provide a brief overview of the main files composing this project.

Files with the extension `mm0` are spec files and provide the axiomatization of our theories. They form the trust base of our formalisation. All axioms and definitions reside in these files. Files with the extension `mm1`, on the other hand, contain proofs of theorems and automations that make use of the axioms and inference rules described in the `mm0` files. These need not be trusted. They are compiled down to `mmb` files which are the binary proof format that the core Metamath Zero checker, `mm0-c` operates on.

The main decision procedure generating the proofs for regular expressions can be found in `regexp-proof-gen.maude`.

* `_automation.mm1` - This file provides some useful automation for writing `mm1` proofs
* `00-matching-logic.mm0` - This file contains the core axiomatization of (Applicative) Matching Logic as well as several useful definitions. It describes the core logic while all other `mm0` files only define theories in this logic.
* `01-propositional.mm1` - This file contains theorems of Propositional Logic (which Matching Logic subsumes)
* `02-ml-normalization.mm1` - This file contains useful theorems for normalising patterns with substitutions, for proving positivity requirements and automation for propagating substitutions though a term
* `10-theory-definedness.mm0` - This file axiomatizes the theory of Definedness. This theory is needed in order to be able to express equality in Matching Logic.
* `11-definedness-normalization.mm1` - This file contains useful theorems for dealing with the newly defined constructs from `10-theory-definedness.mm0`
* `12-proof-system-p.mm1` - This file is the largest `mm1` file and contains proofs for the entirety of "Proof System P" as well as many other useful theorems of Matching Logic. It also contains a number of meta-theorems in the form of lisp-like programs able to generate proofs via automation.
* `13-fixedpoints.mm1` - This file contains the proofs for the `wrap` and `unwrap` rules dealing with contextual implications as well as some theorems about the least fixpoint operator `mu`.
* `20-theory-words.mm0` - This file describes the Matching Logic theory of Regular Expressions. This is a shallow embedding and part of the trust base of our formalisation.
* `21-words-helpers.mm1` - This file contains some useful helpers for dealing with this theory of Regular Expressions.
* `22-words-theorems.mm1` - This file contains most theorems that the maude generator uses when building up a proof. The proof is compiled against these theorems to produce a final `mmb` proof object.
* `regexp-proof-gen.maude` - This is the primary maude file that performs the proof search and generation. It has rules defined that correspond to theorems in `22-words-theorems.mm1` and is applying them strategically, following the algorithm developed by Brozozowski.
* `test` - This is the script used to run our test suite
* `appendix.pdf` Paper submission with appendix
